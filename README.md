# VKITTI 3D Dataset

This is the dataset used to evaluate 3D semantic segmentation of point clouds in [Engelmann et al. ICCV'W17](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/page/3dsemseg) "Exploring Spatial Context for 3D Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds" paper.
The dataset is directly derived from the [Virtual KITTI Dataset](http://www.europe.naverlabs.com/Research/Computer-Vision/Proxy-Virtual-Worlds) (v.1.3.1).

All files here are provided for convenience only, you can generate the whole dataset yourself form the original Virtual Kitti Dataset.

## Usage
We provide all the files as ```.npy``` files.
